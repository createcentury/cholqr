# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-11-07)
- `method="cqr2"`: CholeskyQR2 (two passes), about 1/3 cheaper; for well-conditioned inputs only (cond(Y) <~ 4e3 in FP32).
- `return_r=True`: also return the upper-triangular R with Y = Q R (accumulated exactly across passes, including column scaling).
- `orthonormal_basis` accepts the same options.
- Runtime warning when TF32 matmul is enabled on CUDA (degrades accuracy; measured by CPU emulation).

## 0.1.0 (2026-11-07)
- Shifted CholeskyQR3 for batched tall-skinny matrices; `robust=True` (FP64 first pass); real dtypes only; compile-friendly.
